# FHEEL
WEAR IT. WALK ON IT. FHEEL IT.

FHEEL IS A SHOE THAT CONTROLS BODY TEMPERATURE AND INTERACTS TO WEATHER CHANGES.
FHeel is a wearable technology project based on the use of arduino’s technology and 3d printing design.
When the temperature changes, the sensor sends an input into the circuit that heats or cools the foot that release warmness or coolness, depending on the
need, in order to re-establish basal body temperature and ensure the maintenance of homeostasis.
